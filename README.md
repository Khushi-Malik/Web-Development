# Web Development Learning & Practice

This repository contains my web development learning and practice work.  
I use it to experiment with web technologies ranging from core fundamentals (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) to modern frameworks and tooling (Next.js, Docker), while building small projects, components, and prototypes along the way.

## Scope of Learning
This repository may include work related to:
- HTML5 and semantic markup
- CSS (layouts, Flexbox, responsive design)
- JavaScript (DOM manipulation, basic interactivity)
- Front-end frameworks and libraries (e.g., React, Next.js)
- Tooling and workflows (Git, npm, Docker)
- Small full-stack or deployment experiments as I progress

## Purpose
- Build strong foundations in web development
- Learn by building and iterating
- Experiment freely with new tools and ideas
- Track progress from beginner concepts to more advanced systems

## Structure
The repository may be organized by:
- Topics (e.g., `html-css/`, `javascript/`)
- Mini-projects or experiments
- Iterative versions as my understanding improves

## Status
Actively learning and updating  
Code quality, structure, and complexity will evolve over time.

## Notes
This is a learning-focused repository. Some code may be exploratory or incomplete as I test new concepts and technologies.
